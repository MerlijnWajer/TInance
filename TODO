Short term TODO:
* Add payments options to the ti.py frontend.
* Add MT940 hashes to the database
* Add a few other fields to the database for a member; stuff that helps to
  identify them.
* Have the treasury/parser spit out shell commands that use ti.py, as
  intermediate step after parsing. Workflow could then be like:

  python parse.py MT940XXXXXXX -o xxxxx.sh # Interactive
  $EDITOR xxxxx.sh # Inspect again, fix if needed
  bash xxxxx.sh # Run line per line, executing ti.py with treasury frontend
